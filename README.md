    - Allow administrators to update feature details such as title, description, status, and sorting order.

3.  **Enhanced User Experience:**

    - Improve user experience by offering a centralized platform for users to submit, track, and engage with feature requests.

4.  **Efficient Organization and Prioritization:**

    - Facilitate effective organization and prioritization of feature requests based on status, user feedback, and importance.

5.  **Configurability and Flexibility:**

    - Provide configurability to allow administrators to update the web app's logo, description, and other essential details easily.
